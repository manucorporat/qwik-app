# Welcome

Welcome to the fabulous Qwik City. QwikCity is our official kit to build amazing sites:

- 🐎 Powered by Qwik. Zero hydration and instant interactivity.
- 🗃 File based routing (like Nextjs)
- 🌏 Deploy easily to the edge: Netlify, Cloudflare, Vercel, Deno...
- 📖 Author content directly in Markdown or MDX. MDX brings the best of markdown and JSX, allowing you to render Qwik components directly in markdown, like this one:

<Counter />

## Next steps

Open your editor and check out the following:

**The `src/routes` folder**

This is where the main content lives. Adding folders and / or files (`.md`, `.mdx`, or `.tsx`) will automatically create new URLs. For example, code saved at `routes/dashboard/settings/index.tsx` will be accessible via the URL path `/dashboard/settings`.

**The `src/routes/_layout` files and folders**

These bring form to your content. Since different pages may need to be rendered by different layouts, QwikCity provides the ability to scope layouts to specific routes, while still allowing for easy reuse across different content. For any page without its own layout defined, the `src/routes/_layout.tsx` is used by default.

**The `src/components` folder**

QwikCity is still a normal Qwik app. Any custom component, design systems, or functionality should live here. Notice the `header`, `footer` and `content-nav` components. They are used by the `default` layout!
